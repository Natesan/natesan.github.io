Simple light weight HTML Portfolio Page

Includes sections about my Experiences & Skills, Journals, Books that I read. There are a bunch of different things that I do which did not get in here but that is left for a personal conversation.

It has a nice piece of integration with Goodreads and Twitter widgets. Something that I just stumbled upon trying to experiment with, ended up very well.
